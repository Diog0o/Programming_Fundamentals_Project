## Project Description

### 1. Text Justification
Implement a text justification algorithm that aligns text in a visually appealing manner. This involves adjusting the spacing between words in a line to create an even margin on both sides.

### 2. Hondt Method Implementation
Develop a program that applies the Hondt method, a mathematical algorithm used for allocating seats in proportional representation electoral systems. The program should efficiently distribute seats among parties based on their vote share.

### 3. System of Equations Solver
Create a system of equations solver that handles a set of linear equations. The program should be able to find the solutions for the variables in the system, providing insights into the relationships between them.
